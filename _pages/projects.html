				<h3><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/raethira/Gender-Transformation-using-Adversarial-Networks">Gender Transformation using Adversarial Networks</a></h3>
				Generate gender transformation in a face image data set.  
				Given an image of a male, the generator network is expected to produce a realistic version of the same person as a female and vice versa.

				In this problem, I tried to build a generative model to mimic the writing style of prominent British Mathematician, Philosopher, prolific writer, and political activist, Bertrand Russell.
				<br>Approaches: Trained an LSTM to mimic Russell's style and thoughts.

				<h3><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/raethira/INF-ML-552-Assignments/tree/master/Homework5inf552/Q2">(Deep) CNNs for Image Colorization</a></h3>
				Used a convolutional neural network for image colorization which turns a grayscale image to a colored image.  By converting an image to grayscale,
				we loose color information, so converting a grayscale image back to a colored version is not an easy job. I used the CIFAR-10 dataset.
				<br>Tools: openCV, scikit-learn

				<h3><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/raethira/INF-ML-552-Assignments/tree/master/Homework2inf552">Time Series Classification</a></h3>
				An interesting task in machine learning is classification of time series. In this problem,
I tried to classify the activities of humans based on time series obtained by a Wireless
Sensor Network.
				<br>Approaches: Time-domain features, bootsrap confidence interval, binary classification Using Logistic Regression, p-values, backward selection
using sklearn.feature selection, stratified cross validation, Python's Recursive Feature Elimination, ROC, AUC, L1-penalized logistic regression, L1 regularization, L1-

				<h3><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/raethira/INF-ML-552-Assignments/tree/master/Homework1inf552">Banknote authentication Dataset, Combined Cycle Power Plant Data Set</a></h3>
				Data were extracted from images that were taken from genuine and forged banknote-like specimens. For digitization, an industrial camera usually used for print inspection
was used. The final images have 400x 400 pixels. Due to the object lens and distance
to the investigated object gray-scale pictures with a resolution of about 660 dpi were
gained. Wavelet Transform tool were used to extract features from images.
				<br>Approaches: Scatterplots, box plots, Classification using KNN, Learning curve, Euclidean, Minkowski, Manhattan, Chebyshev, Mahalanobis distances, simple linear regression model,
				association of interactions of predictors with the response using p-values, KNN Regression,
