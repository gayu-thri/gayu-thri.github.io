I am an AI enthusiast, I work at Zoho Corporation, focusing on large language models (LLMs), with a B.Tech. in Computer Science.
 
Life is too short for regrets, so I strongly believe in having no regrets and just learning our lessons. All our actions and decisions have its own consequences which brings us either joy or misery. But each experience no matter how profound, enriches us with lessons we should learn and improve up on. 

I have a wide range of goals, interests and hobbies that allow me to socialize well and even fit within a diverse group of people. I have experience of working in Large Language Models (LLM), Inverse Text Normalization (ITN) and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). Additionally, I'm a CCNA certified student with hands-on experience in routing and switching methods and communication networks. I also have a great interest in making digital arts and playing chess, tennis.
