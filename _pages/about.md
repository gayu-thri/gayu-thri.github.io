A Jack-of-all-trades with a Masters in Computer Science and emphasis on Data Science and Computer Networks.

Life is a constant struggle between being a member of the community and standing out as an individual. I find a balance between both. I am not big on introductions because actions speak louder and I believe people should work until they no longer have to introduce themselves.

I have a wide range of goals, interests and hobbies that allow me to socialize well and fit even with in a diverse group of people. Owing to my industry experience, I have refined my critical thinking and analytical skills, learnt how to effectively meet deadlines, balance priorities while working alone or within a team and work with diverse groups of people to complete assigned projects and tasks. I pride myself on being a fast learner willing to innovate, propose process improvement, contribute to a fast-growing team and take responsibility for my work.
