I am a Master’s student in Data Science at the University of Wisconsin–Madison with 4+ years of experience as an AI Engineer at Zoho Corporation, working on Large Language Models (LLMs) and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). I enjoy building end-to-end AI systems, from curating datasets and developing data pipelines to designing tools that improve model efficiency and team collaboration.

In the LLM space, I’ve worked with HuggingFace APIs, built Streamlit apps for dataset exploration, and scaled translation pipelines to generate hundreds of billions of Indic tokens. In ASR, I’ve integrated rule-based ITN systems using NVIDIA NeMo, improved output readability with custom grammars, preprocessed datasets, and built inference/demo services for internal use.

I thrive at the intersection of data engineering, NLP, and model optimization, skilled in Python, PyTorch, HuggingFace, and adept at transforming raw data into high-quality training resources, designing scalable tools to accelerate research, and applying these resources to train and evaluate models for real-world impact.

Beyond technology, I channel my creativity through digital art, sharpen my strategic thinking through chess, and stay energized with tennis. I thrive on exploring diverse interests, which helps me bring a unique perspective to problem-solving in AI and data science.

Currently, I’m expanding my skills through graduate coursework in algorithms, statistics, and machine learning, while looking for opportunities to contribute to AI-driven projects that make a real-world impact.
