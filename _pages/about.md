Iâ€™m an AI enthusiast at Zoho Corporation, specializing in Large Language Models (LLMs). With a B.Tech. in Computer Science and experience in LLMs, ITN, ASR, and CCNA-certified networking. I bring a strong foundation in technology and innovation.

Guided by curiosity and a thirst for knowledge, I see every experience as an opportunity to grow and evolve. Beyond work, I channel my creativity through digital art, strategy through chess, and energy through tennis, thriving in diverse environments and embracing new challenges.
