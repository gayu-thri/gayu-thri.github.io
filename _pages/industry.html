<a href="https://github.com/raethira/Final-COCOMO-II" target="_blank">COCOMO</a> is a software effort cost estimation model, originally developed by <a href="http://csse.usc.edu/csse/about/people/faculties/barryboehm.html" target="_blank"> Dr. Barry Boehm </a>. There is an old implementation of the model that only runs on Windows. This project is an attempt to re-implement COCOMO in Java so that it is accessible/executable on any OS platform. Most, if not all, of the major functionality, has already been developed. Extensive testing, fixing of bugs, and possible completion of features are implemented. 

<br>•	Tested and fixed counting defects for as many languages as possible. COCOMO (Java)<br>
•	Testing work, with possible bug fixing, few unfinished tasks or features have been implemented.

			<li>Testing work, with possible bug fixing, few unfinished tasks and features have been implemented.
				<ul>
					<li>Setup the environment to run the project and read the USC COCOMO documentation.</li>
					<li>Understanding the team and its members.  Created the project plan for the rest of the semester.</li>
					<li>Went through previous semester test cases and bug reports.</li>
					<li>Executed older version of the software.</li>
					<li>Discovered differences between old windows and newer java version of COCOMO.</li>
					<li>Had to pitch in for testing in Linux, since one of the team members dropped out.</li>
					<li>Setup Linux environment and installed COCOMO.  Implemented various features thus enhancing the user experience in the GUI.</li>
					<li>Implemented Edit, Help menu, fixed existing bugs and tested function points as part of accuracy testing.</li>
					<li>Read the document for manually calculating the FP.</li>
					<li>Implemented print screen, print modification menu, and a screenshot of the COCOMO console, which would increase the user experience.</li>
					<li>Implemented a maintenance feature which includes either updates or repairs and tested on different OS platforms.</li>
					<li>Tested Java model for various random values(manual vs Java calculation), performed validation tests for all input text boxes, added keyboard shortcuts.</li>
					<li>Explored more on COCOMO documentation, API basics commands, and its protocol.  Compiled the final report of the whole semester.</li>

				Cisco Center of Engineering Excellence : <br>

I was part of CCoEE( Cisco Centre of Engineering Excellence ) at Amrita, sponsored by Cisco TAC, which is a partnership program between Amrita and Cisco systems. 
It aims at producing Network Engineers with a strong emphasis on fundamentals and Troubleshooting skills. Training period lasted for 6 months, where we completed our CCNA and CCNP. 
The most challenging part of the program were the knowledge checks by Cisco TAC Engineers at every stage, real world where we will be tested with real-world problems faced by Cisco TAC.
